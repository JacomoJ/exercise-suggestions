# More challenging coding tasks

(Only AdvancedStudents with Lambda allowed)

1. Audio player pt.3

  - Develop a binary search tree `BST<Song>` for the length of the song.
    This includes the necessary data type definitions, an insert function, and a search function.
  - Write a modified `BST<Song>` for search the song title.
  - Write a sorting algorithm for a `List<Song>`

2. Super Mario Rectangle Obstacles
  
  - Write type definitions to hold the rectangular elements (bars) of a jump and run game. 
  - Write a KD-tree for the rectangles. Note that if an Element crosses over a separation in the KD-tree you will need to split it into smaller rectangles that do not cross any separation lines anymore.
 
3. Family tree

  - Write type definitions for a family tree. Note that there the number of children varies now.
  - Write a function that yields a list of persons that are the uncles and aunts of a person in the family tree.

4. Graph

  - Write type definitions to represent a graph.
  - Write a function that checks whether there is an edge from a vertex V1 to another V2.
  - Write a function that yields a list of vertices one can reach starting from a vertex V. Make sure that your function terminates.
